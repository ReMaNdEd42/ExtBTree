# ExtBTree

**ExtBTree** is a powerful C++ container library designed for efficient management of large volumes of data stored in external memory. The library leverages the B-tree structure for data organization and the `mmap` mechanism for mapping data to disk, ensuring high performance and ease of use for data that exceeds the size of the available RAM.

## Key Features

- **B-tree Structure**: Provides fast insertion, deletion, and data lookup through tree balancing.
- **mmap Mechanism**: Efficiently maps files to memory, reducing I/O latency and supporting operations on large datasets.
- **Versatile Containers**: Supports various data types, including primitive types and user-defined structures.
- **Reliability and Resilience**: Ensures safe data storage with protection against failures and data loss.

**ExtBTree** is ideal for applications requiring highly efficient management of large data volumes, such as databases, file systems, and analytical systems.

## Warning

**Please Note:** The current version of the presented project is outdated and contains numerous shortcomings. It lacks significant functionality that could be critical for real-world applications. It is recommended to use this code solely as a demonstration of concept or as a sample implementation. Feel free to contact me for further inquiries.
